# Maple Pie
This project is intended to provide visualizations of open election data from Canadian governments.

The name Maple Pie, a Canadian dessert, comes from the association of maple with Canada and from pie charts. A website providing graphs of Canadian data is the vision for this project.

The project is in its infancy. The intent at this time is to construct commands to handle API calls to various endpoints. The code is written in Golang.
